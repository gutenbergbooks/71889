<p>Find here not one ill word for brave old England;
my first, best friends were English. But for her
policy, her politicians, her speculators, what man with
a heart in him can but hate and abhor them? England’s
best friends to-day are those who deplore this
assault on the farmer Boers, so like ourselves a century
back. Could any man be found strong enough
to stay her hand with sword or pen in this mad hour?
That man would deserve her lasting gratitude. This
feeling of abhorrence holds in England as well as
here. Take for example the following from her
ablest thinker to a friend in Philadelphia:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I rejoice that you and others are bent on showing
that there are some among us who think the national
honor is not being enhanced by putting down the
weak. Would that age and ill health did not prevent
me from aiding.</p>

<p>“No one can deny that at the time of the Jameson
Raid the aim of the Outlanders and the raiders was
to usurp the Transvaal Government, and he must be
willfully blind who does not see what the Outlanders
failed to do by bullets they hope presently to do by
votes, and only those who, while jealous of their own
independence, regard but little the independence of
people who stand in their way, can fail to sympathize
with the Boers in their resistance to political extinction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>“It is sad to see our Government backing those
whose avowed policy is expansion, which, less politely
expressed, means aggression, for which there is a still
less polite word readily guessed. On behalf of these,
the big British Empire, weapon in hand, growls out
to the little Boer Republic, ‘Do as I bid you.’</p>

<p>“I have always thought that nobleness is shown in
treating tenderly those who are relatively feeble and
even sacrificing on their behalf something to which
there is a just claim. But, if current opinion is right,
I must have been wrong.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[B]</a> See report of Julian Hawthorne, sent by a New York magazine
to photograph and give details of the starving in India,
about the time of the Jubilee. He does not give these figures,
but his facts and photographs warrant a fearful estimate. As
for the subjugation of India and the wanton destruction, not only
of life, but the very means of life, this is history. And now,
again, is despoiled India starving,—starving, dying of hunger as
before; even more fearfully, even while England is trying to
despoil the Boers. And when her speculators and politicians
have beaten them and despoiled them of their gold and diamonds
and herds, what then? Why, leave them to starve as in India,
or struggle on in the wilderness as best they can.</p>

<p class="center">WHAT TWO GREAT POPULAR POETS SAY:</p>

<p>Edwin Arnold recently said: “Joaquin Miller is one of the
two greatest American poets.”</p>

<p>James Whitcomb Riley said of Joaquin Miller’s singing: “It
is the truest American voice that has yet thrilled the echoes of
our wild, free land, and awakened the admiration and acclaim
of the Old World. No marvel that our Country is proud of this
proud child of hers, who in all lands has sung her dawning glory
and his own changeless loyalty to her.”</p>

<p><span class="xlarge"><b><i>Songs of the Soul</i></b></span></p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<p>This volume contains this well known poet’s latest,
and as pronounced by all critics, best poetic productions.
The longest poem, entitled “Sappho
and Phaon,” occupies seventy-three pages of the
book, and is destined to become a classic. Besides
this there are several of his older and most popular
poems, such as “Columbus,” “Passing of
Tennyson,” “Sunset and Dawn at San Diego,”
etc., making a 12 mo. volume of 163 pages, with
